### Phonebook Project
This is a simple program using Tkinter. It acts as a phonebook for the user, who can add names, phone numbers, and email addresses. The information that the user inputs is then stored in a database for retrieval later. Of course, it also allows the user to update and delete entries as well.

### File Transfer Program
This program also utilizes Tkinter. It simply moves files from one specified directory to another. I also added additional functionality so that the program only moves files either created or modified within the last 24 hours.

### Web Page Generator
This is another Tkinter program. It displays a simple UI which prompts the user to enter text into a box. It will then take the input text and generate a generic HTML webpage in the user's browser with their text on the page. It also allows the user to generate a default HTML page as well for demonstration purposes.

### Nice or Mean Game
This is a very simple game written in Python. It firsts prompts the user for their name. It then proceeds to give a scenario in which you are greeted by multiple people, and allows the user to be either nice or mean to each of them. Once the player accumulates enough nice or mean points, the game ends, with the player's ending changing based on their overall nice or mean point totals.

### Checkbook Project
This is a project using the Django framework. It is a simple web application where the user can manage a (fictional) bank account. Accounts can be added to the database, and the user can make deposits and withdrawals, as well as add descriptions for each. You can also go back and review the balance history, and when transactions were made.
